# Frontend Mentor - Newsletter sign-up form with success message

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

Challenge is to build out a newsletter form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

We could use any tools we like to help complete the challenge.

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
